- Using Reach Server Components to fetch data using RouterHandlers and SQL statements
  > Keeping expensive data fetches and logic on the server and only sending the result to the client
  > querying the database without using an additional api layer
- Static rendering for UI components without data or data that is shared between all users such as nav components and blog posts
- Dynamic rendering for real time data, user specific contnent, and request time information
